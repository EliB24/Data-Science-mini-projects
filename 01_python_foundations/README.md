# Diabetes Dataset Analysis (Python Foundations)

This project demonstrates essential Python programming foundations using a real medical dataset.  
All processing is performed only with built-in Python tools such as lists, dictionaries,
loops, functions, and `csv.DictReader`.  
The project also includes visualizations created with `matplotlib`.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of the analysis is to understand diabetes prevalence in the dataset and to explore
how it changes across different age groups.

The project includes:

- Loading and converting raw CSV data  
- Computing descriptive statistics (min, max, mean age)  
- Splitting patients into age groups 
- Calculating and comparing diabetes rates in each group  
- Creating visual visualizations of distributions and outcomes  

---

## Files Included

- **01_python_foundations.ipynb** — the main Jupyter Notebook with explanations, code, statistics, and visualizations  
- **diabetes.csv** — source dataset (768 rows, 9 columns)  
- **README.md** — project documentation  

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab**
- **csv** (built-in module for reading CSV files)
- **matplotlib** for plots and charts

## Visualizations in the Notebook

The notebook contains several clear and self-explanatory charts:

- Age distribution histogram  
- Diabetes vs Non-Diabetes count  
- Number of people in each age group  
- Diabetes percentage within:
  - Age group up to 50  
  - Age group 50+
  
  These visualizations help to understand patterns in the dataset and illustrate differences
between younger and older patients.

 ## How to run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab  
2. Run all cells sequentially
